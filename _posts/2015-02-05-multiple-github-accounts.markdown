As a Software Consultant I need a suitable way to deal with multiple github accounts, their ssh keys and  with several source code repositories.

So, I followed the instructions described in the next links and I found a pretty useful way to do this.

I'm very happy with the functionality to continue the git flow as usual. So if you have to deal with the same situation I recommend you following the next steps.

**Steps**

  1. [Register your github accounts](https://github.com/join)
  2. [Generate and associate each ssh key per github account](https://confluence.atlassian.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=271943168)
  3. [Install and configure the git passport hook](https://github.com/frace/git-passport/)
  4. [Execute git passport per repository before to making any git operation](https://github.com/frace/git-passport/)
  5. [Continue the git flow as usual](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)
