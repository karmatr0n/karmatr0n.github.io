I'm a software engineer with experience in backend and tooling development, as well as test automation and security research. 

I also enjoy working in agile teams focused on developing engineering processes that promote quick innovation, simple development and quality control.

During the recent years, I built security tools including a network security scanner, network protocols libraries, and modern managed threat response tools to detect, prevent and respond to cybersecurity threats. I've developed web applications, tooling and managed services to process millions of transactions to communicate multiple platforms.

The technologies I usually use include Ruby, Python, Rust, C, Javascript, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, Docker, Kubernetes and AWS services such as Amazon Cognito, SQS, EC2, Lambdas, Kinesis and DynamoDB.

I like reading books, music, traveling, movies, parties, family and friends.
